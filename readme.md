# NextGameToPlay

A simple node.js script that will tell you what Steam game to play next, based on how many players got the rarest achievement for each game.

It essentially tells you what might be the easiest game in your library to complete 100%.

Example:

    node nextgametoplay.js list_of_games.html

    ...
    Bitburner: 1%
    Wavetale: 10.9%
    Solar Ash: 3.7%
    SOVL: 0.4%
    Dummynation: 0%
    Linelith: 75%
    Monument Valley: 38.9%
    Monument Valley 2: 33.4%
    Stacklands: 10.5%
    DAGURI: Gambling Apocalypse: 2.6%
    Lorelei and the Laser Eyes: 1.7%
    Old World: 0%
    Cult of the Lamb: 1.3%
    Shogun Showdown: 0.7%

    Next game to play: Linelith 75%

## Usage
